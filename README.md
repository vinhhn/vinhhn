- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @vinhhn

Over my four years at the University of St. Thomas, being a Computer Science major, I of course been
assigned to work on projects and assignments. Out of the dozens of projects and assignments I decided
to include two, one from a Computer Visualization class, and the other from Web Development. The third
project is a project I decided to work on my own, satisfying my curiosity for business and how the 
world of trading works.

## Computer Visualization
This class is my most favorite course I have taken at University of St. Thomas. It was a mixture of 
the topic being interesting and having a professor who really enjoyed what he was teaching. This 
class introduced me to an entirely different subject and programming language, Python.

Another exciting part of this class was being able to visually see how your programs affected images.
I stil remember back to the excitement I felt when my program made an image where before, wasn't 
recognizable, to a clearer image. Or when we were all chosen to pick a topic of Computer Visualization
and learning about how each topic related to what we have been doing in the class. Topics such as image
enhancements to make license plates more readable to cameras, High-dynamic range imaging or identifying
people in an image.

In conclusion, I am happy I got to take this class and open my eyes to a whole different world of
computer science and Python. It was a fun, exciting class that I personally think should be a course
that University of St. Thomas still offered to future students.

## Web Development
In this class the focused was creating and learning about web applications, both front-end and back-end.
Using what I learned in this class I started a simple website that is suppose to act as a resume. It
includes a link to my LinkedIn, has a section where my projects are suppose to be and other details that
a regular resume has.

I made this website in hopes to one day, display my experience with Web development to future employers.
In addition, to also have a way to keep my skills with some programming languages such as HTML, CSS,
Javascript, and hopefully in the future, some kind of framework.

## Business and Trading
The final project included in this is a project that fell outside the world of computer science and fell
under business and trading. Financial literacy is an interest of mine and seeing how particular things 
worked in trading is what I think, aids in being more financial literate.

By evaulating data from a Brokerage I used, I was able to gather data to learn when certain trends were
happening. This data was purely used in speculation and was not used in benefit for financial gain, rather
as mentioned before, financial literacy.
